Primal-dual Circle packing of Planar Maps

This work is based on Mohar [1]'s recent algorithm for circle packing for the Euclean case. We implement his polynomial time algorithm for constructing primal-dual circle packings of almost 3-connected planar maps. We have improved Mohar's algorithm and have been able to get near an order of magnitude speed up for large graphs. We describe our implementation in C/C++ style pseudo-code. Keywords Primal-dual circle packing, contact graph, Graph Drawing, Euclean surface. I. Introduction Circle packing of graphs has many applications in the area of computer graphics and computational geometry [2], [3], [4], [5]. It has been studied by many researchers over the recent years [2], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10]. Our work is based on Mohar's recent study on primal-dual circle packing for planar maps [1], [11]. In this paper, we introduce a new method to compute the initialization bound for Mohar' iterative algorithm. The new module takes o(d), where d is the average edge degree of a vertex, to c...
