Weak Interactions on their Crystal Packing (2004)

Abstract. Several new two-ligand complexes of zinc(II) with the aromatic N,N-donor ligands 2,2�-bipyridine or 1,10-phenanthroline and one of three different α-hydroxycarboxylates (HL�) derived of the α-hydroxycarboxylic acids (H 2L�) (2-methyllactic, H 2mL; mandelic, H 2M or benzilic, H 2B) were prepared. The compounds of formula [Zn(HL�) 2(NN)]·nH 2O(HL��HM, HB) were isolated as white powders and characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy and thermogravimetric analysis. The complexes of general formula [Zn(HL�)(NN) 2](HL�)·nH 2O (HL � � HmL, HM) and [Zn(HB) 2(NN) 2], were obtained as single crystals and were characterized by elemental analysis, IR spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis and X-ray diffractometry. In all cases, the zinc atom is in a distorted octahedral environment. In [Zn(HL�)(NN) 2]-(HL�)·nH 2Otheα-hydroxycarboxylato ligands behave as bidentate chelating monoanion and an α-hydroxycarboxylate as counterion is also present. In [Zn(HB) 2(NN) 2], the monoanionic benzilato ligand behaves as monodentate through one oxygen atom of the carboxylate function. The effect of the classical and no-classical hydrogen bonding and of the π-π and C-H...π interactions in the 3D supramolecular arrangement of these molecular complexes is analyzed.
