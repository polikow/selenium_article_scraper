Azimuthal binning for improved fracture delineation

Abstract We propose an alternate way to define azimuth binning in Kirchhoff prestack migration. This new definition takes into account the location of the image point in addition to the source and receiver locations. In this manner, we more properly acknowledge the side-scattering component of the propagation path grouping, assigning our contribution to a given azimuthal bin. We find that data binned in this manner provide better focusing of steeply dipping reflectors, fractures and faults when our velocity model is only approximate. We examine the impact of this new imaging approach on mapping karst-altered fractures in Dickman Field, Ness County, Kansas. Azimuthal binning in prestack migration Kirchhoff migration is a relatively simple operation that can be understood to a great extent using simple geometric concepts to visualize the relationship between the input data and the output image. In Kirchhoff migration, an image at a given position in the subsurface is obtained from data collected at a number of locations within the aperture surrounding the image location. In In a number of applications, including velocity and/or anisotropy analysis, AVO/AVA and prestack inversion and prestack noise attenuation, the data are not migrated into a single image trace but rather organized into partial images obtained from subsets of the data pertaining to a given value or range of values of some geometrical parameter(s). As illustrated in Binning the imaged data into common values of a parameter makes sense as long as that parameter is closely related to the phenomena of interest. Particularly for azimuthal anisotropy analysis, the underlying assumption is that the source-to-receiver azimuth at the surface is representative of the orientation in which the raypath traverses the medium, relative to the symmetry directions of the anisotropy. That orientation determines the extent to which attributes of the imaged data such as traveltime or amplitude are impacted by the anisotropy. Measurements of those attributes as a function of azimuth provide the information necessary for residual velocity analysis as well as to determine anisotropy parameters from the migrated data.
