Three dimensional interstellar extinction map towards the Galactic Bulge (2014)

Context. Studies of the properties of the inner Galactic Bulge depend strongly on the assumptions about the interstellar extinction. Most of the extinction maps available in the literature lack the information about the distance. Aims. We combine the observations with the Besançon model of the Galaxy to investigate the variations of extinction along different lines of sight towards the inner Galactic bulge as a function of distance. In addition we study the variations in the extinction law in the Bulge. Methods. We construct color-magnitude diagrams with the following sets of colors: H–Ks and J–Ks from the VVV catalogue as well as Ks–[3.6], Ks–[4.5], Ks–[5.8] and Ks–[8.0] from GLIMPSE-II catalogue matched with 2MASS. Using the newly derived temperature-color relation for M giants that match better the observed color-magnitude diagrams we then use the distance-color relations to derive the extinction as a function of distance. The observed colors are shifted to match the intrinsic colors in the Besançon model, as a function of distance, iteratively thereby creating an extinction map with three dimensions: two spatial and one distance dimension along each line of sight towards the bulge. Results. Colour excess maps are presented at a resolution of 15′ × 15′for 6 different combinations of colors, in distance bins of
