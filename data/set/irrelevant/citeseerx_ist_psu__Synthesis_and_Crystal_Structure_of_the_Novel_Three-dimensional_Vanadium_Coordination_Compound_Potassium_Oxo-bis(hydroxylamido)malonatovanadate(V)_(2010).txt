Synthesis and Crystal Structure of the Novel Three-dimensional Vanadium Coordination Compound Potassium Oxo-bis(hydroxylamido)malonatovanadate(V) (2010)

In the crystal structure of the title complex, K 2 [(VO) 2 (NH 2 O) 4 (C 3 H 2 O 4 ) 2 ] Â· 3H 2 O, the V(V) centre is bound to a chelating malonate ligand, two bidentate hydroxylamido ligands and one oxo ligand, defining a pentagonal bipyramidal coordination (VO 5 N 2 ). The potassium cations are found to adopt two types of coordination geometry with the malonate ligand, the bidentate hydroxylamido ligand and water molecules: the first one is hepta-coordinate in an irregular K(1)O 7 polyhedron, and the second one is octa-coordinate in an irregular K(2)O 8 polyhedron. The K(1)O 7 /K(2)O 8 and VO 5 N 2 polyhedra are closely linked by sharing faces to form K-V dinuclear units KVO 9 N 2 and KVO 10 N 2 , respectively. The two close-packed units, KVO 9 N 2 and KVO 10 N 2 , are connected by sharing edges to generate a tetrameric unit K 2 V 2 O 17 N 4 . Each of these units is joined to four neighbouring units by sharing corners, providing further propagation into a two-dimensional layer. Adjacent layers are connected via the carboxylic oxygen atoms of the malonate units to give a three-dimensional framework in the crystals.
