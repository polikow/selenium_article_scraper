Abstract We have studied the in vitro reconstitution of sperm nuclei and small DNA templates to mitotic chromatin in Xenopus laevis egg extracts by three-dimensional (3D) electron microscopy (EM) tomography. Using specifically developed software, the reconstituted chromatin was interpreted in terms of nucleosomal patterns and the overall chromatin connectivity. The condensed chromatin formed from small DNA templates was characterized by aligned arrays of packed nucleosomal clusters having a typical 10-nm spacing between nucleosomes within the same cluster and a 30-nm spacing between nucleosomes in different clusters. A similar short-range nucleosomal clustering was also observed in condensed chromosomes; however, the clusters were smaller, and they were organized in 30- to 40-nm large domains. An analysis of the overall chromatin connectivity in condensed chromosomes showed that the 30–40-nm domains are themselves organized into a regularly spaced and interconnected 3D chromatin network that extends uniformly throughout the chromosomal volume, providing little indication of a systematic large-scale organization. Based on their topology and high degree of interconnectedness, it is unlikely that 30–40-nm domains arise from the folding of local stretches of nucleosomal fibers. Instead, they appear to be formed by the close Communicated by E.A.
