Packing Spheres in the Grassmann Manifold: A Geometric Approach to the Noncoherent Multi-Antenna Channel (0)

In this paper, we study the capacity of multiple antenna fading channels. We focus on the channel where the fading coecients vary quickly, thus an accurate estimation of the coefficients are generally not available to either the transmitter or the receiver. We use a noncoherent model proposed by Marzetta and Hochwald. The model does not assume any prior knowledge at the receiver nor the transmitter of the instantaneous fading coefficients, but only assumes that they remain constant for a coherent interval T as an approximation of the continuously varying channel. We compute explicitly the capacity of this channel with N transmit and N receive antennas at high SNR. While the capacity gain of the coherent multi-antenna channel is N bps/Hz for every 3 dB increase in SNR, the corresponding gain for the noncoherent channel turns out to be K(1 K=T ) bps/Hz, where K = minfN; bT=2cg. This is the number of degrees of freedom for noncoherent multi-antenna communications. The capacity expression has ...
