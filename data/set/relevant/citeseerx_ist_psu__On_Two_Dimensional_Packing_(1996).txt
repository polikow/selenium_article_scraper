On Two Dimensional Packing (1996)

The paper considers packing of rectangles into an infinite bin. Similar to the Tetris game, the rectangles arrive from the top and, once placed, cannot be moved again. The rectangles are moved inside the bin to reach their place. For the case in which rotations are allowed, we design an algorithm whose performance ratio is constant. In contrast, if rotations are not allowed, we show that no algorithm of constant ratio exists. For this case we design an algorithm with performance ratio of O(log 1 ffl ), where ffl is the minimum width of any rectangle. We also show that no algorithm can achieve a better ratio than\Omega\Gamma q log 1 ffl ) for this case. 1 Introduction In this paper we consider the problem of orthogonal packing. We are given a bin with a fixed width (assuming equal to 1, without loss of generality) and an unbounded height, and also a set of open oriented rectangles. The rectangles have to be placed in the bin with the bottom of the rectangle parallel to t...
