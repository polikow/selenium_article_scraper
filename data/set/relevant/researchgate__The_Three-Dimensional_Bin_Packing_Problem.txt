The Three-Dimensional Bin Packing Problem

The problem addressed in this paper is that of orthogonally packing a given set of rectangular-shaped boxes into the minimum number of rectangular bins. The problem is strongly NP-hard and extremely difficult to solve in practice. Lower bounds are discussed, and it is proved that the asymptotical worst-case performance of the continuous lower bound is 1 8 . An exact algorithm for filling a single bin is developed, leading to the definition of an exact branch-and-bound algorithm for the three-dimensional bin packing problem, which also incorporates original approximation algorithms. Extensive computational results, involving instances with up to 60 boxes, are presented: it is shown that many instances can be solved to optimality within a reasonable time limit. 1 Introduction We are given a set of n rectangular-shaped boxes, each characterized by width w j , height h j and depth d j (j 2 J = f1; : : : ; ng), and an unlimited number of identical three-dimensional containers (bins) hav...
