A genetic algorithm for the three-dimensional bin packing problem with heterogeneous bins

The three-dimensional bin packing problem (3D-BPP) is to select one or more bins from a set of available bins to pack three dimensional, rectangular boxes such that the usage of the bin space is maximized. 3D-BPP finds wide applications in pharmaceutical industry, transportation and packaging system. In the traditional 3D-BPP, the holding bins are of identical size, while the problem considered in this paper addresses the case where bins are heterogeneous, i.e., varying in size. We present a genetic algorithm along with a novel heuristic packing procedure. The packing heuristic procedure converts box packing sequence and container loading sequence encoded in a chromosome into a compact packing solution. The genetic algorithm is used to evolve such sequences. The algorithm is first applied to 12 industrial instances and then tested on randomly generated instances. The results demonstrate that solutions with high quality can be found within reasonable time.
