A test of the guillotine restrictions determination for a rectangular three dimensional bin packing problem

This paper is an extended version of the paper [9] regarding to the rectangular three dimensional bin packing problem, where a bin is loaded with a set of rectangular boxes, without overlapping but with possible gaps. One of the most popular restriction for the solution of the 3D-bin packing problem is the guillotine restriction. The guillotine restriction requires that the packing patterns should be such that the boxes can be obtained recursively by cutting the bin in two smaller bins, until each bin will contains only one box and no box has been intersected by a cut. Our objective is to find a method to verify if a 3D bin-packing pattern has the guillotine constrains or not. For this purpose we use a weighed graph representations of a solution of the problem, the generalisation of this kind of representation obtained by us for 2D cutting-stock problem in [10, 11, 12].
